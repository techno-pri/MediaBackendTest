Angus Sampson (Fargo) also appears in the heartwarming series as well as up-and-coming stars, Nathalie Morris and Carlos Sanson Jnr who plays her baby daddy, Santiago. \n\nWe chat to the rising stars, Nathalie and Carlos about the drama that's sure to find its way into your heart, too."

She's motivated by great female leaders, like Jacinda Ardern, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and she manages to ignore most of what's going on in her personal life because she's so set on achieving her long-term goals: to study at Harvard and work for the UN. Oly gives birth to a surprise baby in the first few minutes of the show, and this shock arrival kicks off a wild chain of events that forces her to face up to the uncomfortable, scary, thrilling, chaotic parts of her life, step outside of her comfort zone, and find out what she's really made of. \n\n**Carlos:** Santi is a creative trapped in a jock's body, he is a boy's boy, a talented football player, and cheeky at times but his passion lie's in the arts. Deep down, Santi is a romantic, and he uses his art as an outlet to express his feelings. In particular, the feelings he doesn't quite know how to articulate."

That's one of the things I love most about the show - it's celebration of mistakes, awkward moments, and bizarre behaviour.\n\nI couldn't relate to the motherhood aspect of the show at first, but there were so many mothers in the cast and crew that shared their hilarious -  and horrifying - stories with me throughout the shoot and showed me how to hold a baby, breastfeed, change a nappy etc. - those conversations were actually one of the greatest parts about being in this production.  \n\n**Carlos: ** Santi and I are very very similar, sometimes you hear people talk about how they were born to play certain roles. It definitely feels that way for me, especially when I look at the parallels between Santi and I. We were both born in Australia with Chilean parents, we both love football, we both got into trouble at school, we both follow our creative pursuits (mine acting, his art), and to be honest, we are both sensitive guys…yes it's true, I like to think I'm in touch with my emotions. \n\nI think the biggest difference between us is Santi's naivety. He is younger, still in school, and in a way sheltered from the real world. That is until of course he is forced to deal with adult problems (like raising a baby). I guess he's got the baby department over me!"

Sometimes we felt the urge to laugh to break the awkwardness but she urged us to stay only in relationship with each other during those scenes and not with anyone else in the room. \n\n**Carlos:** It was something I had never done before so it was a really interesting process, and a great learning experience. We had an intimacy coach for rehearsals and on set, who, much like choreographing a fight scene, guided us through movements, boundaries, places we could touch, places we couldn't. It was all about supporting your scene partner with what they felt comfortable with, communication was key."

She also did down a fair amount of beer and shots, that could be the more plausible explanation,\" Claudia says when we put this to her.\n\nAnother character we can expect to see more of is Santi's grandmother Rosa, played by Paula Garcia. The breakout star is the heart and soul of *Bump*, perfectly encapsulating the adoring matriarch role. \n\n\"We were so lucky to find Paula. She had only recently moved to Brisbane from Paris with her family. She's a consummate performer - very experienced, natural and funny. We're looking forward to giving her much more story in series two,\" Claudia tells us. \n\n[**Every new show and movie coming to Stan this January 2021, so you can binge watch your way through summer**](https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/tv/stan-january-2021-66278|target=\"_blank\")"
